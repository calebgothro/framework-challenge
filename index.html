      <p>Mental health has become a topic that is much more commonly talked about, which is <strong>great!</strong> For years and years, people would be silently suffering without doing anything about it, feeling <strong>guilty</strong>, <strong>ashamed</strong>, and <strong>alone</strong>. Nowadays, people are much more aware of these issues, and are much more likely to do something about them. For many, therapy is the first and best choice, especially when the issues they are dealing with are crippling and debilitating. However, for many people, their therapy journey can start to seem to stagnate or plateou after working through some of those initial issues.</p>
