      <h3 class="text-center">Why Life Coaching?</h3>
      <p>Mental health has become a topic that is much more commonly talked about, which is <strong>great!</strong> For years and years, people would be silently suffering without doing anything about it, feeling <strong>guilty</strong>, <strong>ashamed</strong>, and <strong>alone</strong>. Nowadays, people are much more aware of these issues, and are much more likely to do something about them. For many, therapy is the first and best choice, especially when the issues they are dealing with are crippling and debilitating. However, for many people, their therapy journey can start to seem to stagnate or plateou after working through some of those initial issues.</p>

        For many people, the educational redtape around therapy can often restrict the benefit they get from it after they get their feet back under them. For people who are at a stabile point in life and want to take that next step, having someone who can help them <strong>set good goals</strong>, <strong>improve their routines</strong>, and <strong>create the life they've always wanted</strong> can be massively helpful. That's where life coaching comes in.

      <h3 class="text-center">About Me</h3>
      <p>I went to a top tier business school, and graduated with really good grades. From there, I worked in the corporate financial district for years. As a kid, I always wanted to be wealthy and successful, and I thought this was the best way to acheive that. For the first few years, it was. I was making more money than I ever expected, and the prospect of rising up the corporate ladder kept me ambitious and excited. After over ten years of this, however, I experienced a personal crisis. I realized that, despite all the money and success, I was deeply unhappy. As a result of such a competitive field, I despised all my coworkers. More than that, I had no realy social life outside of work, and spent all my money on material things, which I thought would fulfill me. I realized that I was completely alone. I decided to make a change. I quit my job and went to the Himalayas, where I learned some of the ancient meditation techniques, and when I came back, I was able to find a group of great friends, reconnect with my family, and even start my own. I realized that there had to be more people like me who just needed some guidance in order to reach the life they've always wanted deep down. I started my life coaching business in 2015, where I've helped hundreds of people reach their goals, from changing their career or starting their own business to completely changing their lifestyle and becoming much healthier. I would love to use my coaching expertise to help you reach that next step</p>
